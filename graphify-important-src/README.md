## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Tables:
- **users**: User accounts with soft delete support
- **expenses**: Shared expenses with receipt photos
- **settlements**: Payment records between users
- **wallet_snapshots**: Historical balance states
- **expense_paybacks**: Individual payback tracking

### Key Relationships:
- Users have many expenses (as payer)
- Users have many settlements (as payer/receiver)
- Expenses belong to users (paid_by_user_id)
- Settlements reference two users (from_user_id, to_user_id)
- Wallet snapshots track balance changes over time

## 🌐 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/` | Main dashboard with expenses and balances |
| POST | `/expenses` | Create new expense |
| POST | `/settlements` | Record settlement payment |
| GET | `/settings` | User management page |
| POST | `/settings/users` | Update user list |
| DELETE | `/settings/users/{user}` | Soft delete user |
| POST | `/settings/users/{user}/reactivate` | Reactivate user |
| GET | `/wallet-snapshots` | Get historical balance data |

## 🧠 How the Automatic Debt Reduction Works

SplitMate features a sophisticated algorithm that automatically reduces debts when someone pays for an expense:

### Example Scenario:
1. **Alice** owes **Bob** $20
2. **Alice** pays for a $30 dinner (split 3 ways = $10 each)
3. **Alice's** $10 share automatically reduces her debt to Bob from $20 to $10
4. **Bob** now owes **Alice** $10 (the reduction amount)
5. The remaining $20 is split normally among the group

### Key Benefits:
- **No Manual Work**: Debts are reduced automatically
- **Optimal Cash Flow**: Highest debts are reduced first
- **Transparent Calculations**: Every step is explained in detail
- **Historical Accuracy**: All calculations are preserved and auditable

## 🎯 Usage Guide

    ]
  }
}
```

## 🌐 Hosting Configuration

### Removing `/public` from URLs

When deploying to shared hosting, you typically need to remove `/public` from your URLs. Here are several methods:

#### Method 1: Move Files (Recommended for Shared Hosting)

1. **Move all files from `public/` to root directory**
   ```bash
   # Move all files from public/ to your domain root
   mv public/* ./
   mv public/.* ./
   rmdir public
   ```

2. **Update `index.php`**
   ```php
   // Change this line in index.php:
   require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
   // To:
   require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
   
   // Change this line:
   $app = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';
   // To:
   $app = require_once __DIR__.'/bootstrap/app.php';
   ```

#### Method 2: Apache .htaccess (If you have access to document root)

Create a `.htaccess` file in your domain root:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    
    # Redirect to public folder
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/public/
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /public/$1 [L,QSA]
</IfModule>
```

#### Method 3: Nginx Configuration

Add this to your Nginx server block:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    root /path/to/your/splitmate/public;
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

#### Method 4: cPanel/Shared Hosting

1. **Upload your Laravel files** to a subdirectory (e.g., `splitmate/`)
2. **Create a subdomain** pointing to `splitmate/public/`
3. **Or use the File Manager** to move contents of `public/` to `public_html/`

#### Method 5: Using .htaccess Redirect

If you can't modify the document root, create this `.htaccess` in your domain root:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/public/
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /public/$1 [L]
```

### Environment Variables for Production

Update your `.env` file for production:

```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your-database-name
DB_USERNAME=your-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-password

# Add your production settings here
```

### File Permissions

Set proper permissions for your hosting:

```bash
# Set directory permissions
chmod -R 755 storage bootstrap/cache
chmod -R 644 .env

# Make sure storage is writable
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow
